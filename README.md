## Day 15
<h2>starting reading Grokking algorithms book and finished the first chapter</h2>
<h3>talking about</h3>
The first chapter of "Grokking Algorithms" introduces the reader to the fundamental concept of algorithms and their importance in solving problems. It emphasizes the ubiquitous nature of algorithms in our daily lives, from simple tasks to complex processes. The chapter also provides an overview of what algorithms are and how they differ from computer programs. Additionally, it introduces the concept of Big O notation, a way to analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms in terms of their time and space complexity. Overall, the first chapter sets the stage for understanding the role and significance of algorithms in computer science and problem-solving.

## Day 19
<h2>Reading chapter 2 from Grokking Algorithms Book</h2>
<h3>Talking about</h3>
In this chapter, the focus is on fundamental data structures and a basic sorting algorithm. Arrays and linked lists, two essential data structures, are introduced. Arrays, already touched upon in Chapter 1, are highlighted as crucial and frequently used throughout the book. However, the chapter also emphasizes that linked lists can be more advantageous in certain situations, and it aims to provide insights into the pros and cons of both structures, enabling readers to make informed choices for their algorithms.
<br>
The chapter further introduces the concept of sorting algorithms, starting with the explanation of selection sort. Sorting is essential for various algorithms, including binary search, which can only be performed on a sorted list of elements. While many programming languages come with built-in sorting algorithms, the chapter presents selection sort as a foundational sorting algorithm. Additionally, it sets the stage for understanding more advanced sorting algorithms like quicksort, which will be covered in the next chapter. The understanding of selection sort is positioned as a valuable precursor to grasping quicksort, contributing to a deeper comprehension of this important algorithm.

## Day 22
<h2>Chapter 3 Grokking algorithms book</h2>
<h3>talking about</h3>
In this chapter, the focus is on recursion, a fundamental coding technique widely employed in various algorithms. Recursion serves as a crucial building block for comprehending subsequent chapters in the book. The chapter delves into the methodology of breaking down problems into two essential components: the base case and the recursive case. This approach lays the foundation for the divide-and-conquer strategy. The divide-and-conquer strategy employs the simplicity of this concept to effectively solve complex problems. Overall, the chapter serves as an introduction to recursion, highlighting its significance in algorithmic problem-solving and its role in preparing readers for more advanced strategies discussed later in the book.
